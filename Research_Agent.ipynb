To fulfill the need for rapid\\nacquisition of desired information, various information re-\\ntrieval (IR) systems have been developed [1–4]. Prominent\\nexamples include search engines such as Google, Bing, and\\nBaidu, which serve as IR systems on the Internet, adept at\\nretrieving relevant web pages in response to user queries,\\nand provide convenient and efficient access to information\\non the Internet. It is worth noting that IR extends beyond\\nweb page retrieval. In dialogue systems (chatbots) [1, 5–\\n8], such as Microsoft Xiaoice [2], Apple Siri, 1 and Google\\nAssistant,2 IR systems play a crucial role in retrieving appro-\\npriate responses to user input utterances, thereby producing\\nnatural and fluent human-machine conversations. Similarly,\\nin question-answering systems [3, 9], IR systems are em-\\nployed to select relevant clues essential for addressing user\\nquestions effectively. In image search engines [4], IR systems\\nexcel at returning images that align with user input queries.\\nGiven the exponential growth of information, research and\\nindustry have become increasingly interested in the devel-\\nopment of effective IR systems.\\nThe core function of an IR system is retrieval, which aims\\nto determine the relevance between a user-issued query\\nand the content to be retrieved, including various types\\nof information such as texts, images, music, and more.

To improve the user experience, the retrieval\\nperformance is enhanced from both the upstream (query\\nreformulation) and downstream (reranking and reading)\\nperspectives. As an upstream technique, query reformu-\\nlation is designed to refine user queries so that they are\\nmore effective at retrieving relevant documents [10, 11].\\nWith the recent surge in the popularity of conversational\\nsearch, this technique has received increasing attention. On\\nthe downstream side, reranking approaches are developed\\nto further adjust the document ranking [12–14]. In contrast\\nto the retrieval stage, reranking is performed only on a\\nlimited set of relevant documents, already retrieved by the\\nretriever. Under this circumstance, the emphasis is placed\\non achieving higher performance rather than keeping higher\\nefficiency, allowing for the application of more complex ap-\\nproaches in the reranking process. Additionally, reranking\\ncan accommodate other specific requirements, such as per-\\nsonalization [15–18] and diversification [19–22]. Following\\nthe retrieval and reranking stages, a reading component is\\nincorporated to summarize the retrieved documents and de-\\nliver a concise document to users [23, 24]. While traditional\\nIR systems typically require users to gather and organize\\nrelevant information themselves; however, the reading com-\\n3. The term “document” will henceforth refer to any text-based con-\\ntent subject to retrieve, including both long articles and short passages.\\narXiv:2308.07107v4  [cs.CL]  4 Sep 2024\\n2\\nRewriter\\nRetriever\\nReranker\\nNew Queries\\nCandidateDocumentsSelectedDocuments\\nReader\\nLarge Language Models\\nChatGPTLLaMA GLM\\nFlan-T5\\n …\\nBLOOMResponse\\nSearch Context\\nQuery𝑛\\nQuery1\\nResponse1\\n⋯\\nTraditional IR Components\\nSearch Agent\\nQuery2\\nResponse2\\n(1)\\n(2)\\nFig. 1.

Initially, IR was anchored in\\nterm-based methods [25] and Boolean logic, focusing on\\nkeyword matching for document retrieval. The paradigm\\ngradually shifted with the introduction of vector space mod-\\nels [26], unlocking the potential to capture nuanced semantic\\nrelationships between terms. This progression continued\\nwith statistical language models [27, 28], refining relevance\\nestimation through contextual and probabilistic considera-\\ntions. The influential BM25 algorithm [29] played an im-\\nportant role during this phase, revolutionizing relevance\\nranking by accounting for term frequency and document\\nlength variations. The most recent chapter in IR’s journey\\nis marked by the ascendancy of neural models [3, 30–\\n32]. These models excel at capturing intricate contextual\\ncues and semantic nuances, reshaping the landscape of IR.\\nHowever, these neural models still face challenges such as\\ndata scarcity, interpretability, and the potential generation of\\nplausible yet inaccurate responses. Thus, the evolution of IR\\ncontinues to be a journey of balancing traditional strengths\\n(such as the BM25 algorithm’s high efficiency) with the\\nremarkable capability (such as semantic understanding)\\nbrought about by modern neural architectures.\\nLarge language models (LLMs) have recently emerged as\\ntransformative forces across various research fields, such as\\nnatural language processing (NLP) [33–35], recommender\\nsystems [36–39], finance [40], and even molecule discov-\\nery [41]. These cutting-edge LLMs are primarily based on\\nthe Transformer architecture and undergo extensive pre-\\ntraining on diverse textual sources, including web pages,\\nresearch articles, books, and codes. As their scale continues\\nto expand (including both model size and data volume),\\nLLMs have demonstrated remarkable advances in their ca-\\npabilities. On the one hand, LLMs have exhibited unprece-\\ndented proficiency in language understanding and genera-\\ntion, resulting in responses that are more human-like and\\nbetter aligned with human intentions. On the other hand,\\n4. New Bing, https://www.bing.com/new\\nthe larger LLMs have shown impressive emergent abilities\\nwhen dealing with complex tasks [42], such as generaliza-\\ntion and reasoning skills. Leveraging the impressive power\\nof LLMs can undoubtedly improve the performance of IR\\nsystems. By incorporating these advanced language models,\\nIR systems can provide users with more accurate responses,\\nultimately reshaping the landscape of information access\\nand retrieval.\\nInitial efforts have been made to utilize the potential of\\nLLMs in the development of novel IR systems. Notably, in\\nterms of practical applications, New Bing is designed to\\nimprove the users’ experience of using search engines by\\nextracting information from disparate web pages and con-\\ndensing it into concise summaries that serve as responses\\nto user-generated queries. In the research community, LLMs\\nhave proven useful within specific modules of IR systems\\n(such as retrievers), thereby enhancing the overall perfor-\\nmance of these systems. Due to the rapid evolution of LLM-\\nenhanced IR systems, it is essential to comprehensively\\nreview their most recent advancements and challenges.\\nOur survey provides an insightful exploration of the\\nintersection between LLMs and IR systems, covering key\\nperspectives such as query rewriters, retrievers, rerankers,\\nand readers (as shown in Figure 1). 5 We also include some\\nrecent studies that leverage LLMs as search agents to per-\\nform various IR tasks. This analysis enhances our under-\\nstanding of LLMs’ potential and limitations in advancing\\nthe IR field. For this survey, we create a Github repository by\\ncollecting the relevant papers and resources about applying\\nLLMs for IR tasks (LLM4IR). 6 We will continue to update\\nthe repository with newer papers. This survey will also be\\nperiodically updated according to the development of this\\narea. We notice that there are several surveys for PLMs,\\nLLMs, and their applications ( e.g., AIGC or recommender\\nsystems) [43–49]. Compared with them, we focus on the\\ntechniques and methods for developing and applying LLMs\\nfor IR systems. In addition, we suggest reading the strategy\\n5. As yet, there has not been a formal definition for LLMs. In this pa-\\nper, we mainly focus on models with more than 1B parameters. We also\\nnotice that some methods do not rely on such strictly defined LLMs, but\\ndue to their representativeness, we still include an introduction to them\\nin this survey.\\n6. https://github.com/RUC-NLPIR/LLM4IR-Survey'}}}], 'role': 'user'}, 'invocation_id': 'e-6c079805-1a85-40d7-83b0-829f404e126f', 'author': 'research_analyst', 'actions': {'state_delta': {}, 'artifact_delta': {}, 'requested_auth_configs': {}, 'requested_tool_confirmations': {}}, 'id': '52b8ad5f-d3ac-4596-ab79-40ba783f5b8b', 'timestamp': 1763439384.653204}\n",

Title:** Large Language Models for Information Retrieval: A Survey\\n\\n**2. Problem:** Traditional search engines (Information Retrieval or IR systems) struggle with understanding the real meaning behind search queries, dealing with limited training data, and giving accurate answers. They need a boost to become more effective.\\n\\n**3. Background / Motivation:**  Think of Google search. It's pretty good, but sometimes it misses the point or doesn't quite understand what you're *really* asking. Large Language Models (LLMs) like ChatGPT are super smart at understanding and using language. Researchers are exploring how to use these LLMs to make search engines much better. LLMs can capture the *nuances* of language, where older systems often just look for keywords.\\n\\n**4. Method / Model:** This paper is a *survey*. That means it looks at a lot of different research papers and projects that are trying to combine LLMs and IR systems. It examines how LLMs can be plugged into different parts of the search process:\\n*   **Query Rewriting:** LLMs rephrase your search query to make it clearer for the search engine.\\n*   **Retrieval:** LLMs help the system find the most relevant documents in the first place.\\n*   **Reranking:** LLMs re-order the search results to put the best ones at the top.\\n*   **Reading/Summarization:** LLMs read the retrieved documents and create short summaries for you.\\n*   **Search Agents:** LLMs can act as autonomous agents that handle a variety of search tasks.\\n\\n**5. Dataset / Inputs:** This is a survey paper, so there's no single dataset. However, the papers it reviews use standard information retrieval datasets (e.g., collections of web pages, scientific articles, etc.) and user queries. The *input* to these combined systems is typically a user's search query.\\n\\n**6. Results:** This is a survey, so there is no single result. However, the survey highlights that LLMs *do* show promise in improving search results. For example, using LLMs to rewrite queries or re-rank documents often leads to more relevant results compared to traditional methods. The effectiveness depends on the specific task and how the LLM is integrated.\\n\\n**7. Strengths:**\\n*   **Clear Overview:** Provides a good overview of how LLMs are being used in different parts of the information retrieval process.\\n*   **Comprehensive:** Covers query rewriting, retrieval, re-ranking, reading/summarization, and the emerging area of search agents.\\n*   **Practical Focus:** Highlights the practical applications of LLMs for improving search.\\n*   **LLM4IR Repository**: The authors are actively curating a GitHub repository which is a useful resource.\\n\\n**8. Limitations:**\\n*   **Rapidly Evolving Field:** The field is changing *very* quickly. So some of the specific techniques discussed might become outdated fast.\\n*   **Cost & Efficiency:** LLMs can be computationally expensive, which can be a problem for large-scale search engines. The survey acknowledges that efficiency is crucial for IR systems.\\n*   **Bias and Fairness:** Like any AI system, LLMs can have biases that affect search results. This is an ongoing challenge.\\n\\n**9. Key Takeaways:**\\n\\n*   LLMs are powerful tools for understanding and generating language.\\n*   They can be used to improve various parts of the information retrieval process.\\n*   Query rewriting, retrieval, and re-ranking are key areas where LLMs can help.\\n*   Search agents are an emerging area with the potential for more automated search experiences.\\n*   Efficiency and cost are important considerations when using LLMs in search engines.\\n*   Bias in LLMs is a concern that needs to be addressed.\\n*   This is an active research area with lots of ongoing development.\\n*   LLMs can understand semantic relationships between queries and documents\\n\\n**10.
